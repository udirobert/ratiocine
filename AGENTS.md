# AGENTS.md — ratiocine

Guidance for AI agents (and humans) working on this project.

## What this is

An IOL-AI 2026 competitor. The goal: submit a `script.py` to a public Hugging Face repo that solves International Linguistics Olympiad problems. Deadline: **July 26, 2026, 23:59 UTC** (the competition is only a few days long).

## Two-track approach

### Track 1: Arkor rapid prototyping (`src/arkor/`)

Arkor is a TypeScript fine-tuning framework. Use it to validate training data format and model approach in ~10 min runs.

```bash
pnpm dev           # opens Studio at localhost:4000
```

The `trainer.ts` has a `onCheckpoint` callback that does mid-run evaluation against a sample IOL problem. If the model can solve the sample, the approach works. The `translate` template is the closest starting point.

**Limitations:** Arkor currently only supports `gemma-4-E4B-it`, can't export trained models, and can't self-host inference. Use it only for fast validation, not the final submission.

### Track 2: HF production pipeline (`hf-pipeline/`)

The actual submission pipeline. Fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B (or 3B) with `SFTTrainer` + 4-bit bitsandbytes, push to HF Hub, and wrap in `script.py`.

```bash
cd hf-pipeline
python dataset.py                      # generate training data
python train.py                        # fine-tune (needs GPU)
# then follow submission/README.md to push to HF
```

The submission format:
- Model weights + `script.py` in a **public** HF model repo
- `script.py` reads `/tmp/data/test.csv`, writes `submission.csv`
- No internet at eval time — everything must be in the repo
- T4 16GB, 30 min limit, bitsandbytes + autoawq pre-installed

## Data format

The competition uses the Linguini format. Each row of `test.csv` has:
- `id` — problem ID (echo back unchanged)
- `context` — problem data (bilingual examples, hints)
- `query` — numbered items to answer
- `work_lang` — instruction language (FLORES code)
- `task_lang` — problem language (FLORES code)
- `task_type` — e.g. translation, fill_blanks, text_to_num
- `eval_type` — single or multi (multi accepts multiple correct answers)

Training data lives in `data/synthetic/iol_train.jsonl` as chat-format messages. Add more synthetic problems to improve the model.

## Scoring

score = √(exact_match_weighted · chrF)

Geometric mean of weighted exact match and character n-gram overlap. Both needed — exact hits alone or fuzzy overlap alone won't score well. Add an `explanation` column to opt into the human jury track.

## Synthetic data generation

To create more training data:
1. Find past IOL problems (ioling.org has archives)
2. Reformat into the instruction format in `dataset.py`
3. Add to `data/synthetic/iol_train.jsonl`
